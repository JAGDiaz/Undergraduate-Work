I ate a tasty pancake for breakfast and an egg over-easy, for there is no breakfast superior to this. 
After that I attended my CS-320 Lecture, and I learned that Professor Healey likes videogames, yet the Professor distrusts technology. 
The lecture was interesting, so I'll do my best on the homework, but I'll also confess that I've done a similar assignment in Perl.
